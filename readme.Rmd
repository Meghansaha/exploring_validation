# Resources for "*Exploring Data Validation with the `pointblank` Package*

</center>

## About

This repository contains supplemental resources and materials that coincide with the [*Exploring Data Validation talk*](https://www.meetup.com/cleveland-user-group/events/284903377/) presented on Wednesday, October 12th for the Cleveland R User Meetup Group. This talk will provide information on what data validation is, why it's important, and how R users can begin using the [Rich Iannone](https://twitter.com/riannone) and Mauricio Vargas' [pointblank](https://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/) package to validate their own data in R.

## Presentation and Slides

The slides for this workshop can be viewed [here](https://meghansaha.github.io/exploring_validation/).

This presentation was recorded and is available on YouTube [here](https://t.co/181jd0X3e9).
